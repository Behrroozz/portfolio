I joined this restaurant group of four branches in Cape Town to focus on boosting delivery sales and improving operational efficiency. My role involved restructuring the menu, introducing new staff training guidelines, and leading the transition from traditional practices to a modern, delivery-focused approach.

Despite the challenge of implementing significant changes while the restaurants continued operating in their old style, we successfully doubled delivery sales. In addition, we maintained a 4.7-star customer rating on delivery platforms for a full year, reflecting both stronger systems and improved customer experience.
