I organized and facilitated Startup Weekend events across five cities, managing all aspects of planning and execution to ensure seamless operations. I coordinated with venues, sponsors, and partners to secure resources and support, while leading diverse teams of participants to foster collaboration and innovation.

I guided teams through problem-solving, facilitated workshops and mentorship sessions, and oversaw the judging process to evaluate pitches. Additionally, I cultivated relationships with mentors, judges, and sponsors, promoted the events through social media and other channels, and created networking opportunities to connect participants with industry experts.

Throughout, I addressed challenges proactively to ensure a positive, impactful experience for all participants.
