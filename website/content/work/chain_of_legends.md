I joined the team for a 3-month project to lead and achieve specific growth goals for this crypto-based game. My role was to design and implement new workflow processes focused on attracting new players and increasing the value of the in-game token. 

Through coordinated strategies and execution, we successfully gained over 40,000 new players, and the token price rose by more than 30% during the project period.
