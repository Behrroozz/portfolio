Built this startup from the ground up with zero initial investment. The service allowed customers to send family photos online, which we then printed on high-quality materials and delivered to them. The concept addressed the growing desire for physical keepsakes, particularly albums for children. 

Over nearly seven years, I grew the business to serve over 60,000 customers. Managing sensitive personal data was a key responsibility, and upon closing the business to relocate to Dubai, all customer data was securely deleted.
