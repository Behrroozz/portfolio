As one of the pioneers of the startup community in my city, I joined this accelerator to help early-stage teams transform their ideas into viable business models. I guided startups in defining roadmaps from concept to growth, connecting them with investors, and refining their strategies.

In parallel, I organized events and collaborated with the marketing team to attract talented founders and mentors, helping strengthen the local startup ecosystem.
