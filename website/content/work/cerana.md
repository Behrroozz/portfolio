I founded this company and built a team of designers and marketing specialists to provide branding and marketing services for B2B clients. Over two years, we helped various companies strengthen their brand presence and marketing strategies.

Eventually, I closed the company to focus on a new startup I launched within this venture, evolving the brand from Cerana into Seranaz, which later became a successful online printing service.
