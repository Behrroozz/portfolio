Right after earning my bachelor’s degree in IT, I joined GreenWeb and began managing their social media presence, with a special focus on Instagram at a time when it was still a new and emerging platform. I worked across multiple brands, developing strategies to grow audiences and attract customers. 

Over time, we expanded our services to bring in external clients for digital marketing solutions. In addition, I organized events and exhibitions that boosted the company’s visibility. Even after moving on, I maintained a strong connection with the company and continued collaborating with them on specific projects.
