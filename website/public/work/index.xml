My role was to design and implement new workflow processes focused on attracting new players and increasing the value of the in-game token.
Through coordinated strategies and execution, we successfully gained over 40,000 new players, and the token price rose by more than 30% during the project period.</description></item><item><title>SERANAZ ONLINE PRINTING SERVICE</title><link>https://behroozshahri.com/work/seranaz/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://behroozshahri.com/work/seranaz/</guid><description>Built this startup from the ground up with zero initial investment. The service allowed customers to send family photos online, which we then printed on high-quality materials and delivered to them. The concept addressed the growing desire for physical keepsakes, particularly albums for children.
Over nearly seven years, I grew the business to serve over 60,000 customers. Managing sensitive personal data was a key responsibility, and upon closing the business to relocate to Dubai, all customer data was securely deleted.</description></item></channel></rss>
